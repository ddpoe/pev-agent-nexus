# pev

Plan-Execute-Validate agent workflow for Claude Code. Structured code changes through explicit phases — separate agents for planning, implementing, reviewing, and validating. Human approval gates between each. Cortex integration for codebase and doc graph awareness.

This file is the landing page for the plugin. Dig deeper in:

- **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** — first-install checklist and version-to-version migration. **Start here after installing.**
- **[USER_GUIDE.md](./USER_GUIDE.md)** — how to invoke `/pev-cycle` and `/pev-instance`, what you see at each approval gate, customizing PEV for your project via `.pev/` SOPs.
- **[DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)** — architecture, tool permissions matrix, hook model, invariants. For anyone modifying or extending the plugin.
- **[../../plugins/hook-spike/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../hook-spike/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** — debugging plugin hooks when something silently fails.

## What's in this plugin

Two user-invocable skills (you run these directly):

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/pev-cycle` | Full multi-agent workflow for non-trivial changes (new features, cross-cutting refactors, anything touching core mechanisms). Architect → Builder → Reviewer → Auditor → Doc Reviewer, in an isolated worktree, explicit human gates per phase. |
| `/pev-instance` | Slim single-agent mode for small, well-scoped tasks (docstring fixes, single-file bug fixes, small refactors). Mini-pitch → human gate → implement → structured self-review → checkin doc. Runs in the working tree, no worktree isolation. Escalates to `/pev-cycle` when a task turns out bigger than scoped. |

Plus `/pev-spike` (11-test integration smoke test for the PEV hook infrastructure — you usually won't need this unless you're debugging PEV itself).

## Quick start

1. Install both plugins (pev + the companion hook-spike for debugging) and set up project directories: see **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** (~3 minutes, one-time).

2. Run a full cycle:
```
/pev-cycle add a history endpoint that filters by date range
```
You'll be walked through Architect planning, human approval, Builder implementation, Reviewer validation, and Auditor doc updates. Full phase-by-phase guide in [USER_GUIDE.md](./USER_GUIDE.md).

3. For small work:
```
/pev-instance fix typo in README install section
```

## Customizing for your project

PEV reads three optional DocJSON SOPs from `<your-project-root>/.pev/`:

| File | Configures |
|---|---|
| `doc-topology.json` | Project doc taxonomy — categories, update triggers, per-category Auditor actions, Doc Reviewer checks |
| `test-policy.json` | Test tiers, annotation contract, coverage expectations |
| `review-criteria.json` | Reviewer's project-specific emphasis (logging conventions, anti-patterns) |

Absent files fall back to plugin-shipped templates at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`. Customize by copying a template into your `.pev/` and editing. The templates are self-documenting — each section explains what field shapes the agents' behavior.

Details in [USER_GUIDE.md](./USER_GUIDE.md#customizing-via-pev-sops).

## Requirements

- [axiom-graph](https://github.com/ddpoe/axiom-graph) MCP installed and configured in your project — PEV uses it for codebase reads, doc graph, and cycle manifest persistence
- A git repository (`/pev-cycle` creates a worktree; `/pev-instance` commits in-place)

## Status

Current version: **2.1.0**. See [../../CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for release history and breaking changes. The plugin is actively used in ~3 consumer projects.
